# Withered Away (Front End)

The backend could be found [here](https://github.com/niananto/withered-away-back).

## Get started locally

Clone the repository or just download the zip and unzip at one of your preferable folders. In the project directory, you should run:

### `npm i yarn -g`
### `yarn install`

This should install all the dependencies from the package.json (don't tamper with it). Ignore any warnings. You must have the latest version of npm and yarn for this to work which is currently 8.5.0 and 1.22.17 for me.

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser. This should automatically start after compiling.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!
